Introduce Yourself
------------------
I have been into web dev for 9 years, have built a [client-side MVC][halo], [jsmin with sourcemaps][jsmin], [a spritesheet with variables tool][spritesmith], and [smaller utilities for developers][projects].

I have been a big BDD enthusiast and would like to introduce people, cover why it is practical, and what I think the future holds.

[jsmin]:https://github.com/twolfson/grunt-jsmin-sourcemap
[spritesmith]: https://github.com/Ensighten/grunt-spritesmith
[projects]: http://twolfson.com/projects
